## Miniflux upgrade to v2.2.14 may require manual work

Due to a migration in Miniflux v2.2.14, you may find that your Miniflux service fails to start with an error:

> [Migration v119] pq: must be owner of extension hstore

[This issue](https://github.com/miniflux/v2/issues/3849) affects older Miniflux installations which made use of an `hstore` Postgres extension. If the `hstore` extension is owned by a user other than `miniflux`, the migration trying to drop it will hit an error. Newer Miniflux versions never installed that extension and the migration does not need to drop it.

You can fix this issue before upgrading to Miniflux v2.2.14 or after an unsuccessful upgrade by:

1. Running this one-liner on your MASH server: `/mash/postgres/bin/cli-non-interactive -d miniflux -c "DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS hstore;"`
2. Restarting the Miniflux service

## authentik no longer requires a Redis-compatible datastore

Since authentik [2025.10.0](https://docs.goauthentik.io/releases/2025.10), a Redis-compatible datastore (we used to recommend [Valkey](docs/services/valkey.md)) is no longer necessary. authentik no longer uses a Redis-compatible datastore at all (moving all that into Postgres).

If you have an existing authentik installation, you may now wish to remove all Valkey-related integration settings.

## Adapting Immich/Postgres to changes in the Postgres role

The [Postgres](./docs/services/postgres.md) role was recently updated (see [this commit](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres/commit/b39dcdf3421a4b3d7c4a758c9b533399ede4547b)) to add support for restricting the versions that it's allowed to install.

These changes have landed into MASH playbook and we're making use of them to make [Postgres](./docs/services/postgres.md) play better with [Borg Backup](./docs/services/backup-borg.md) and avoid the risk of suffering from issues like this: [Unable to use borg backup after postgresql 18 upgrade](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/issues/4632).

Due to these changes, **users who install Immich/Postgres** for the [Immich](./docs/services/immich.md) service now **need to update their `vars.yml` file** [like this](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/commit/297c414bddb37f82e066d14b66b4ae2cf4b78318), or the playbook will encourage them to upgrade to *vanilla* Postgres v18 (which is not what Immich needs).

While at it, Immich users can **consider upgrading to Immich/Postgres v18** as described in the comments seen in [the same commit](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/commit/297c414bddb37f82e066d14b66b4ae2cf4b78318) and using a new variable override of `postgres_container_image_v18_version: 18-vectorchord0.5.3-pgvector0.8.1`. After all the upgrade steps and final cleanup are done, your `vars.yml` would only contain Postgres v18 references, as seen [here](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/commit/f4dff6927e12eda413e768ab5a58ab09a434c1ba).

## Tandoor 2.0 Update: Path Prefix & API Changes

### (BC Break) Tandoor can no longer be installed under a path prefix

Right now, installing Tandoor under a path prefix like `/tandoor/` isn‚Äôt supported anymore.

So please make sure in your setup that:

- you **don‚Äôt set** the `tandoor_path_prefix` variable
- you **don‚Äôt override** the `tandoor_container_labels_traefik_path_prefix` variable

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to keep using a path prefix, you‚Äôll need to:
>
> - comment out the last `fail` task (lines 36‚Äì39) in the `validate-config.yml` of the Tandoor Ansible role
> - tweak the nginx template to properly handle a prefixed path (like fixing location blocks, headers, and static/media file serving)
>
> This isn‚Äôt officially supported right now ‚Äî but **we‚Äôd be happy if you contribute a pull request to bring back smooth path prefix support!**

---

### Tandoor updated to version 2.0 ‚Äî API changes may break third-party apps

Tandoor has been updated to version 2.0. This release includes **breaking changes to the API**, which may cause some third-party apps to stop working.

Here‚Äôs what that means:

- **Untare** was built for the old API ‚Äî it no longer works with Tandoor 2.0 and is **no longer maintained**
- **Kitshn** is being actively developed, but only a **beta version** supports Tandoor 2.0

You can find more details in the official release notes:
https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/releases/tag/2.0.0

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ IPv6 support enablement recommended by default

Our [default example configuration](./examples/vars.yml) and [Configuring DNS](./docs/configuring-dns.md) guides now recommend enabling [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) support. We recommend that everyone enables IPv6 support for their Matrix server, even if they don't have IPv6 connectivity yet.

Our new [Configuring IPv6](./docs/configuring-ipv6.md) documentation page has more details about the playbook's IPv6 support.

**Existing playbook users** will **need to do some manual work** to enable IPv6 support. This consists of:

- enabling IPv6 support for the Docker container networks:
	- add `devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_enabled: true` to their `vars.yml` configuration file
	- stop all services (`just stop-all`)
	- delete all container networks on the server: `docker network rm $(docker network ls -q)`
	- re-run the playbook fully: `just install-all`

- [configuring IPv6 (`AAAA`) DNS records](./docs/configuring-ipv6.md#configuring-dns-records-for-ipv6)

> [!WARNING]
> Not all mash-playbook Ansible roles respect the `devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_enabled` setting yet.
> Even if you enable this setting, you may still see that some container networks and services aren't IPv6-enabled.
> **Consider sending pull requests** for the playbook roles that do not respect the `devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_enabled` setting yet.

## Docker daemon options are no longer adjusted when IPv6 is enabled

We landed initial IPv6 support in the past via a `devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_enabled` variable that one had to toggle to `true`.

This variable did **2 different things at once**:

- ensured that container networks were created with IPv6 being enabled
- adjusted the Docker daemon's configuration to set `experimental: true` and `ip6tables: true` (a necessary prerequisite for creating IPv6-enabled networks)

Since Docker 27.0.1's [changes to how it handles IPv6](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/27/#ipv6), **adjusting the Docker daemon's configuration is no longer necessary**, because:
- `ip6tables` defaults to `true` for everyone
- `ip6tables` is out of the experimental phase, so `experimental` is no longer necessary

In light of this, we're introducing a new variable (`devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_daemon_options_changing_enabled`) for controlling if IPv6 should be force-enabled in the Docker daemon's configuration options.
Since most people should be on a modern enough Docker daemon version which doesn't require such changes, this variable defaults to `false`.

This change affects you like this:

- ‚úÖ if you're **not explicitly enabling IPv6** (via `devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_enabled` in your configuration): you're unaffected
- ‚ùì if you're **explicitly enabling IPv6** (via `devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_enabled` in your configuration):
  - ‚úÖ .. and you're on a modern enough Docker version (which you most likely are): the playbook will no longer mess with your Docker daemon options. You're unaffected.
  - üîß .. and you're on an old Docker version, you **are affected** and need to use the following configuration to restore the old behavior:

    ```yml
    # Force-enable IPv6 by changing the Docker daemon's options.
    # This is necessary for Docker < 27.0.1, but not for newer versions.
    devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_daemon_options_changing_enabled: true

    # Request that individual container networks are created with IPv6 enabled.
    devture_systemd_docker_base_ipv6_enabled: true
    ```

## (BC Break) Postgres, Traefik & Woodpecker CI roles have been relocated and variable names need adjustments

Various roles have been relocated from the [devture](https://github.com/devture) organization to the [mother-of-all-self-hosting](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting) organization.

Along with the relocation, the `devture_` prefix was dropped from their variable names, so you need to adjust your `vars.yml` configuration.

You need to do the following replacements:

- `devture_postgres_` -> `postgres_`
- `devture_traefik_` -> `traefik_`
- `devture_woodpecker_ci_` -> `woodpecker_ci_`

As always, the playbook would let you know about this and point out any variables you may have missed.

## Traefik v3 and HTTP/3 are here now

**TLDR**: Traefik was migrated from v2 to v3. Minor changes were done to the playbook. Mostly everything else worked out of the box. Most people will not have to do any tweaks to their configuration. In addition, [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) support is now auto-enabled for the `web-secure` (port 443) and `matrix-federation` (port `8448`) entrypoints. If you have a firewall in front of your server and you wish to benefit from `HTTP3`, you will need to open the `443` and `8448` UDP ports in it.

### Traefik v3

The reverse-proxy that the playbook uses by default (Traefik) has recently been upgraded to v3 (see [this blog post](https://traefik.io/blog/announcing-traefik-proxy-v3-rc/) to learn about its new features). Version 3 includes some small breaking configuration changes requiring a [migration](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/migration/v2-to-v3/).

We have **updated the playbook to Traefik v3** (make sure to run `just roles` / `make roles` to get it).

Most (all) MASH roles should not require any changes and should work with Traefik v3 by default.

**Most people using the playbook should not have to do any changes**.

If you're using the playbook's Traefik instance to reverse-proxy to some other services of your own (not managed by the playbook), you may wish to review their Traefik labels and make sure they're in line with the [Traefik v2 to v3 migration guide](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/migration/v2-to-v3/).

If you've tweaked any of this playbook's `_path_prefix` variables and made them use a regular expression, you will now need to make additional adjustments. The playbook makes extensive use of `PathPrefix()` matchers in Traefik rules and `PathPrefix` does not support regular expressions anymore. To work around it, you may now need to override a whole `_traefik_rule` variable and switch it from [`PathPrefix` to `PathRegexp`](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/routers/#path-pathprefix-and-pathregexp).

You **may potentially downgrade to Traefik v2** (if necessary) by adding `traefik_verison: v2.11.4` to your configuration.


### HTTP/3 is enabled by default

In Traefik v3, [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) support is no longer considered experimental now.
Due to this, **the playbook auto-enables HTTP3** for the `web-secure` (port 443) entrypoint.

HTTP3 uses the UDP protocol and **the playbook (together with Docker) will make sure that the appropriate port** (`443` over UDP) **is exposed and whitelisted in your server's firewall**. However, **if you have another firewall in front of your server** (as is the case for many cloud providers), **you will need to manually open this UDP port**.

If you do not open the UDP port correctly or there is some other issue, clients (browsers, mostly) will fall-back to [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) or even [HTTP/1.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP).

Still, if HTTP/3 cannot function correctly in your setup, it's best to disable advertising support for it (and misleading clients into trying to use HTTP/3).

To **disable HTTP/3**, you can use the following configuration:

```yml
traefik_config_entrypoint_web_secure_http3_enabled: false
```

## Postgres parameters are automatically tuned now

The playbook has provided some hints about [Tuning PostgreSQL](docs/maintenance-postgres.md#tuning-postgresql) for quite a while now.

From now on, the [Postgres Ansible role](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.postgres) automatically tunes your Postgres configuration with the same [calculation logic](https://github.com/le0pard/pgtune/blob/master/src/features/configuration/configurationSlice.js) that powers https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/.

Our [Tuning PostgreSQL](docs/maintenance-postgres.md#tuning-postgresql) documentation page has details about how you can turn auto-tuning off or adjust the automatically-determined Postgres configuration parameters manually.

## (Backward Compatibility Break) authentik container variables renamed

For the authentik role there have been two containers: `authentic_worker_container` and `authentic_server_container`. To simplify the configuration, it was reduced to one container.

As the role is pretty young and to avoid confusion because of legacy and reverted design decisions all variables containing `authentik_server_container` will now start with authentik_container. This means you will have to rename these variables in your `vars.yml` if you already use authentik. If you use a standard setup this only includes the change below:

- `authentik_server_container_additional_networks_custom` -> `authentik_container_additional_networks_custom`

# 2023-03-29

## (Backward Compatibility Break) Firezone database renamed

If you are running [Firezone](docs/services/firezone.md) with the default [Postgres](docs/services/postgres.md) integration the playbook automatically created the database with the name `mash-firezone`.
To be consistent with how this playbook names databases for all other services, going forward we've changed the database name to be just `firezone`. You will have to rename you database manually by running the following commands on your server:

1. Stop Firezone: `systemctl stop mash-firezone`
2. Run a Postgres `psql` shell: `/mash/postgres/bin/cli`
3. Execute this query: `ALTER DATABASE "mash-firezone" RENAME TO firezone;` and then quit the shell with `\q`

Then update the playbook (don't forget to run `just roles`), run `just install-all` and you should be good to go!

## (Backward Compatibility Break) PeerTube is no longer wired to Redis automatically

As described in our [Redis](docs/services/redis.md) services docs, running a single instance of Redis to be used by multiple services is not a good practice.

For this reason, we're no longer auto-wiring PeerTube to Redis. If you're running other services (which may require Redis in the future) on the same host, it's recommended that you follow the [Creating a Redis instance dedicated to PeerTube](docs/services/peertube.md#creating-a-redis-instance-dedicated-to-peertube) documentation.

If you're only running PeerTube on a dedicated server (no other services that may need Redis) or you'd like to stick to what you've used until now (a single shared Redis instance), follow the [Using the shared Redis instance for PeerTube](docs/services/peertube.md#using-the-shared-redis-instance-for-peertube) documentation.


# 2023-03-25

## (Backward Compatibility Break) Docker no longer installed by default

The playbook used to install Docker and the Docker SDK for Python by default, unless you turned these off by setting `mash_playbook_docker_installation_enabled` and `devture_docker_sdk_for_python_installation_enabled` (respectively) to `false`.

From now on, both of these variables default to `false`. An empty inventory file will not install these components.

**Most** users will want to enable these, just like they would want to enable [Traefik](docs/services/traefik.md) and [Postgres](docs/services/postgres.md), so why default them to `false`? The answer is: it's cleaner to have "**everything** is off by default - enable as you wish" and just need to add stuff, as opposed to "**some** things are on, **some** are off - toggle as you wish".

To enable these components, you need to explicitly add something like this to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# Docker                                                               #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

mash_playbook_docker_installation_enabled: true

devture_docker_sdk_for_python_installation_enabled: true

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /Docker                                                              #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

Our [example vars.yml](examples/vars.yml) file has been updated, so that new hosts created based on it will have this configuration by default.

## Initial release

This is the initial release of this playbook.
