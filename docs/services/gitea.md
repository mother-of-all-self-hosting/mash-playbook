# Gitea

[Gitea](https://gitea.io/) is a painless self-hosted Git service. You may also wish to look into [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) - a fork of Gitea that this playbook also [supports](forgejo.md).

> [!WARNING]
> [Gitea is Open Core](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/102) and your interests may be better served by using and supporting [Forgejo](forgejo.md) instead. See the [Comparison with Gitea](https://forgejo.org/compare-to-gitea/) page for more information. You may also wish to see our [Migrating from Gitea](./forgejo.md#migrating-from-gitea) guide.


## Dependencies

This service requires the following other services:

- a [Postgres](postgres.md) database
- a [Traefik](traefik.md) reverse-proxy server


## Configuration

To enable this service, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file and re-run the [installation](../installing.md) process:

```yaml

# gitea                                                                #
#                                                                      #

gitea_enabled: true

# Gitea uses port 22 by default.
# We recommend that you move your regular SSH server to another port,
# and stick to this default.
#
# If you wish to use another port, uncomment the variable below
# and adjust the port as you see fit.
# gitea_ssh_port: 222

gitea_hostname: mash.example.com
gitea_path_prefix: /gitea

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /gitea                                                               #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

In the example configuration above, we configure the service to be hosted at `https://mash.example.com/gitea`.

You can remove the `gitea_path_prefix` variable definition, to make it default to `/`, so that the service is served at `https://mash.example.com/`.


## Usage

After installation, you should be able to access your new Gitea instance at the configured URL (see above).

Going there, you'll be taken to the initial setup wizard, which will let you assign some paswords and other configuration.


## Recommended other services

You may also wish to look into [Woodpecker CI](woodpecker-ci.md), which can integrate nicely with Gitea.
