qbittorrent_enabled: true

qbittorrent_hostname: qbittorrent.example.com

# The path where downloaded files will be stored on the host system
qbittorrent_download_path: "{{ qbittorrent_base_path }}/downloads"

# The path at which qbittorrent_download_path is mounted to inside the container
qbittorrent_download_bind_path: "/downloads"

# The port qBittorrent is listening for torrents on inside the container
qbittorrent_container_torrenting_port: 6881

# Controls whether the container exposes its torrenting port
# To become an "active node" you'll want to set this and configure port-forwarding in your router
qbittorrent_container_torrenting_bind_port: "{{ qbittorrent_container_torrenting_port }}"

# /qbittorrent                                                         #
#                                                                      #

### URL

In the example configuration above, we configure the service to be hosted at `https://qbittorrent.example.com`.

A `qbittorrent_path_prefix` variable can be adjusted to host under a subpath (e.g. `qbittorrent_path_prefix: /qbittorrent`), but this hasn't been tested yet.

## Usage

After [installation](../installing.md), you should access your new qBittorrent instance at the URL you've chosen.

To login you'll need to obtain the **temporary** randomly generated password for your instance, to get this run `just run-tags print-qbittorrent-password`

Once you've got that, login as the `admin` user with the password and change it under `Tools -> Options -> WebUI` in the `Authentication` section. Make sure you change the password, since the default one is temporary and will change with each start-up.

For additional configuration options, refer to [ansible-role-qbittorrent](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-qbittorrent)'s `defaults/main.yml` file.

## Intergration with Sonarr/Radarr

To add qBittorrent to your [Sonarr](sonarr.md) or [Radarr](radarr.md) instance navigate to the form at `Settings > Download Clients > Add > qBittorrent`:

Set the `host` field to your qBittorrent URL (without the protocol) and `port` as 443. Make sure to click `Use SSL`. Set the `username` and `password` fields as your qBittorrent credentials. 

Fill in the rest of the form with your preferences, and you're done!
