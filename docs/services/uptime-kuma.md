## Usage

When you open the Uptime Kuma's web UI for the first time, it starts a setup wizard where you'll create your admin credentials. You can then add monitors for web services as many as you like.

If you have enabled a self-hosted [ntfy](ntfy.md) server, it is possible to set up the Uptime Kuma instance to have it send notifications to a ntfy's "topic" (channel) when the monitored web service is down, without relaying them through servers owned and controlled by third parties.
