# Uptime Kuma

The playbook can install and configure [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) for you.

Uptime Kuma is a fancy self-hosted monitoring tool similar to [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/). It has functions such as monitoring uptime for HTTP(s), TCP, DNS Record, Steam Game Server, and Docker Containers, etc.

See the project's [documentation](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki) to learn what Uptime Kuma does and why it might be useful to you.

For details about configuring the [Ansible role for Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-uptime_kuma), you can check them via:
- üåê [the role's documentation](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-uptime_kuma/blob/main/docs/configuring-uptime-kuma.md) online
- üìÅ `roles/galaxy/uptime_kuma/docs/configuring-uptime-kuma.md` locally, if you have [fetched the Ansible roles](../installing.md)

## Dependencies

This service requires the following other services:

- a [Traefik](traefik.md) reverse-proxy server

## Configuration

To enable this service, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file and re-run the [installation](../installing.md) process:

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# uptime-kuma                                                          #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

uptime_kuma_enabled: true

uptime_kuma_hostname: uptime-kuma.example.com

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /uptime-kuma                                                         #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

**Note**: hosting Uptime Kuma under a subpath (by configuring the `uptime_kuma_path_prefix` variable) does not seem to be possible due to Uptime Kuma's technical limitations.

## Usage

When you open the Uptime Kuma's web UI for the first time, it starts a setup wizard where you'll create your admin credentials. You can then add monitors for web services as many as you like.

If you have enabled a self-hosted [ntfy](ntfy.md) server, it is possible to set up the Uptime Kuma instance to have it send notifications to a ntfy's "topic" (channel) when the monitored web service is down, without relaying them through servers owned and controlled by third parties.

## Troubleshooting

See [this section](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting//ansible-role-uptime_kuma/blob/main/docs/configuring-uptime-kuma.md#troubleshooting) on the role's documentation for details.
