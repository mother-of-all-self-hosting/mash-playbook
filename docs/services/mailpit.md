# Mailpit

The playbook can install and configure [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) for you.

Mailpit is the SMTP server which catches any messages sent to it and displays in a web interface instead of sending it to the outside of the internal network, making it possible to check messages without using an actual email address. It also implements [POP3 server](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/configuration/pop3/) to download captured messages directly to your email client, [spam checker](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/usage/spamassassin/) to check how much possible messages will be detected as spam, etc.

While the service is primarily intended to be used for testing (bulk mail sending simulation, etc), it can also be used to receive messages from other services of this playbook directly, improving the security related to sensitive information such as a temporary password.

See the project's [documentation](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/) to learn what Mailpit does and why it might be useful to you.

For details about configuring the [Ansible role for Mailpit](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden/rad%3Az3BKJz8wwtQHfXm8MPX81h4izT2QS), you can check them via:
- 🌐 [the role's documentation](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden/rad%3Az3BKJz8wwtQHfXm8MPX81h4izT2QS/tree/docs/configuring-mailpit.md) online
- 📁 `roles/galaxy/mailpit/docs/configuring-mailpit.md` locally, if you have [fetched the Ansible roles](../installing.md)

## Dependencies

This service requires the following other services:

- [Traefik](traefik.md) reverse-proxy server

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable this service, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file and re-run the [installation](../installing.md) process:

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# mailpit                                                              #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

mailpit_enabled: true

mailpit_hostname: mailpit.example.com

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /mailpit                                                             #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### Configuring HTTP Basic authentication

The HTTP Basic authentication on Traefik is enabled for the web interface by default, considering the nature of the service. See [this section](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden/rad%3Az3BKJz8wwtQHfXm8MPX81h4izT2QS/tree/docs/configuring-mailpit.md#web-ui) on the role's documentation for details about how to set it up or disable it.

### Configuring POP3 server (optional)

While the SMTP server can be used without setting credentials, **the POP3 server requires you to specify a pair of username and password**. See [this section](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden/rad%3Az3BKJz8wwtQHfXm8MPX81h4izT2QS/tree/docs/configuring-mailpit.md#pop3-server) on the role's documentation for details.

## Usage

After running the command for installation, the Mailpit instance becomes available at the hostname `mash-mailpit`. Its web interface is hosted at `https://mailpit.example.com`, with the configuration above.

### Configuring SMTP server settings

To use Mailpit with other services of this playbook, you can configure the setting about the SMTP server to point it to `mash-mailpit` with the port number `1025`. As Mailpit just works on the same network as those services do, you can set any random email address (even nonexistent one like `example@example.com` or `a@a.com`) to the service.

For example, you can get the [asciinema server](asciinema-server.md) send logging in or user registration messages to Mailpit by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file, so that the service will use the SMTP server instead of the default [exim-relay](exim-relay.md) mailer:

```yaml
asciinema_server_mailer_enabled: true
asciinema_server_environment_variable_smtp_host: "{{ mailpit_identifier }}"
asciinema_server_environment_variable_smtp_port: 1025
asciinema_server_environment_variable_mail_from_address: SET_ANY_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE
```

You can check the message sent by the asciinema server at `https://mailpit.example.com`.

💡 Since the message is not sent to the outside of the internal Docker network, the chance of man-in-the-middle attacks is drastically reduced.

### Using POP3 server

To download messages from the POP3 server, you can configure your email client so that it connects to `mailpit.example.com` via the port **1110**. Make sure to set the username and password for authentication.

## Troubleshooting

See [this section](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden/rad%3Az3BKJz8wwtQHfXm8MPX81h4izT2QS/tree/docs/configuring-mailpit.md#troubleshooting) on the role's documentation for details.
