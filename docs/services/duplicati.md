# Duplicati

The playbook can install and configure [Duplicati](https://duplicati.com) for you.

Duplicati is a backup software that securely stores encrypted, incremental, compressed backups on local storage, cloud storage services and remote file servers. It works with standard protocols like FTP, SSH, WebDAV as well as popular services like Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon S3 (compatible) Object Storage, Google Drive, box.com, Mega, B2, and many others.

See the project's [documentation](https://docs.duplicati.com) to learn what Duplicati does and why it might be useful to you.

For details about configuring the [Ansible role for Duplicati](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-duplicati), you can check them via:
- üåê [the role's documentation](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-duplicati/blob/main/docs/configuring-duplicati.md) online
- üìÅ `roles/galaxy/duplicati/docs/configuring-duplicati.md` locally, if you have [fetched the Ansible roles](../installing.md)

>[!NOTE]
> As the Duplicati instance runs as the Docker container, it is necessary to mount the directory which includes files to back up on the host machine. Note that it is not able for the container to access files **outside of the mounted directory**.
>
> If you wish to manage a backup of directories on the machine without such restriction, you might probably want to consider to install Duplicati directly on the host machine. See [this page on the official documentation](https://docs.duplicati.com/getting-started/installation) for details.

## Dependencies

This service requires the following other services:

- [Traefik](traefik.md) reverse-proxy server

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable this service, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file and re-run the [installation](../installing.md) process:

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# duplicati                                                            #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

duplicati_enabled: true

duplicati_hostname: duplicati.example.com

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /duplicati                                                           #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

**Note**: hosting Duplicati under a subpath (by configuring the `duplicati_path_prefix` variable) does not seem to be possible due to Duplicati's technical limitations.

### Mount a directory for files to backup

You can mount the directory by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
duplicati_source_path: /path/on/the/host
```

Make sure permissions and owner of the directory specified to `duplicati_source_path`.

For example, you can mount the default directory used by the playbook (`/mash`) by adding the following configuration:

```yaml
duplicati_source_path: /mash
```

### Set a password for the UI

You also need to set a log in password on the web UI by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
duplicati_environment_variable_duplicati__webservice_password: YOUR_WEBUI_PASSWORD_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_WEBUI_PASSWORD_HERE` with your own value.

## Usage

After running the command for installation, Duplicati becomes available at the specified hostname like `https://duplicati.example.com`.

See [this section](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-duplicati/blob/main/docs/configuring-duplicati.md#usage) for details about setting up a backup task.

‚ö†Ô∏è When setting the Source Data option, **choose `source` or directories inside it** as the backup source.

### Configure the SMTP mailer (optional)

On Duplicati you can set up the mailer to have it send reports about backup status. **You can use Exim-relay as the mailer, which is enabled on this playbook by default.** See [this page about Exim-relay configuration](exim-relay.md) for details about how to set it up.

As the Duplicati instance does not support configuring the mailer with environment variables, you can add default options for it on its UI (and override them with options for each job). Refer to [this page](https://docs.duplicati.com/detailed-descriptions/sending-reports-via-email/sending-reports-with-email) on the official documentation as well about how to configure it.

To set the default options, open `https://duplicati.example.com/ngax/index.html#/settings` to add the following configuration to "Default options" area (adapt to your needs):

```txt
--send-mail-from=noreply@mash.example.com
--send-mail-to=RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_HERE
--send-mail-url=smtp://mash-exim-relay:8025
--send-mail-level=Warning,Error
```

Replace `noreply@mash.example.com` and `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_HERE` with the email address which should send and receive reports, respectively. If the default Exim-relay is used, `noreply@mash.example.com` should be replaced with the one specified on your `vars.yml` file.

Since the default report message is fairly verbose, you might probably want to customize it with the `send-mail-body` option.

## Troubleshooting

See [this section](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-duplicati/blob/main/docs/configuring-duplicati.md#troubleshooting) on the role's documentation for details.
