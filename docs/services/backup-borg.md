# Setting up borg backup (optional)

The playbook can install and configure [borgbackup](https://www.borgbackup.org/) with [borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/) for you.
BorgBackup is a deduplicating backup program with optional compression and encryption.
That means your daily incremental backups can be stored in a fraction of the space and is safe whether you store it at home or on a cloud service.

You will need a remote server where borg will store the backups. There are hosted, borg compatible solutions available, such as [BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com).

The backup will run based on `backup_borg_schedule` var (systemd timer calendar), default: 4am every day.

By default, Borg backups will include a dump of your database if you're using the [integrated Postgres server](postgres.md) or the [integrated MariaDB server](mariadb.md). An alternative solution for backing up the Postgres database is [postgres backup](configuring-playbook-postgres-backup.md).

If you decide to go with another solution:

- you can disable Postgres-backup support for Borg using the `backup_borg_postgresql_enabled` variable.
- you can disable MariaDB-backup support for Borg using the `backup_borg_mysql_enabled` variable.

If you're using an external database server (regardless of type), you may point borgbackup to it. See the `backup_borg_postgresql_*` or `backup_borg_mysql_*` variables.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a new SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f borg-backup -C MASH
```

This can be done on any machine and you don't need to place the key in the `.ssh` folder. It will be added to the Ansible config later.

1. Add the **public** part of this SSH key (the `borg-backup.pub` file) to your borg provider/server:

If you plan to use a hosted solution, follow their instructions. If you have your own server, copy the key over:

```bash
# example to append the new PUBKEY contents, where:
# PUBKEY is path to the public key,
# USER is a ssh user on a provider / server
# HOST is a ssh host of a provider / server
cat PUBKEY | ssh USER@HOST 'dd of=.ssh/authorized_keys oflag=append conv=notrunc'
```

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

Minimal working configuration (`inventory/host_vars/<yourdomain>/vars.yml`) to enable borg backup:

```yaml

where:

* USER - SSH user of a provider/server
* HOST - SSH host of a provider/server
* REPO - borg repository name, it will be initialized on backup start, eg: `mash`, regarding Syntax see [Remote repositories](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/general.html#repository-urls)
* PASSPHRASE - passphrase used for encrypting backups, you may generate it with `pwgen -s 64 1` or use any password manager
* PRIVATE KEY - the content of the **private** part of the SSH key you created before. The whole key (all of its belonging lines) under `backup_borg_ssh_key_private` needs to be indented with 2 spaces

To backup without encryption, add `backup_borg_encryption: 'none'` to your vars. This will also enable the `backup_borg_unknown_unencrypted_repo_access_is_ok` variable.

`backup_borg_location_source_directories` defines the list of directories to back up: it's set to `{{ mash_playbook_base_path }}` by default, which is the base directory for every service's data, such as Nextcloud, Postgres and all others. You might want to exclude certain directories or file patterns from the backup using the `backup_borg_location_exclude_patterns` variable.

Check the `roles/galaxy/backup-borg/defaults/main.yml` file for the full list of available options.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the [installation](installing.md) command again:

```
just install-all
```

## Manually start a backup

For testing your setup it can be helpful to not wait until 4am. If you want to run the backup immediately, log onto the server
and run `systemctl start mash-backup-borg`. This will not return until the backup is done, so possibly a long time.
Consider using [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) if your SSH connection is unstable.
