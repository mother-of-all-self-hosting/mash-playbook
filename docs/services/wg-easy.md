# WireGuard Easy

[WireGuard Easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy) is the easiest way to run [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN + Web-based Admin UI.

Another more powerful alternative for a self-hosted WireGuard VPN server is [Firezone](firezone.md). WireGuard Easy is easier, lighter and more compatible with various ARM devices.


## Dependencies

This service requires the following other services:

- a [Traefik](traefik.md) reverse-proxy server
- a modern Linux kernel which supports WireGuard


## Configuration

To enable this service, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file and re-run the [installation](../installing.md) process:

```yaml

### URL

In the example configuration above, we configure the service to be hosted at `https://mash.example.com/wg-easy`.

You can remove the `wg_easy_path_prefix` variable definition, to make it default to `/`, so that the service is served at `https://mash.example.com/`.


### Networking

**In addition** to ports `80` and `443` exposed by the [Traefik](traefik.md) reverse-proxy, the following ports will be exposed by the WireGuard containers on **all network interfaces**:

- `51820` over **UDP**, controlled by `wg_easy_environment_variables_additional_variable_wg_port` and `wg_easy_container_wireguard_bind_port` - used for [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) connections

Docker automatically opens these ports in the server's firewall, so you **likely don't need to do anything**. If you use another firewall in front of the server, you may need to adjust it.

### Additional configuration

For additional configuration options, see the upstream documentation's [Options](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-easy#options) section.

You can inject additional environment variables with this additional configuration:

```yaml
wg_easy_environment_variables_additional_variables: |
  WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS: 10.6.0.x
  WG_MTU: 1420
```

## Usage

After installation, you can go to the WireGuard Easy URL, as defined in `wg_easy_hostname` and `wg_easy_path_prefix`.

You can authenticate with the password set in `wg_easy_environment_variables_additional_variable_password`.

You can then create various Clients and import the configuration for them onto your devices - either by downloading a file or by scanning a QR code.
