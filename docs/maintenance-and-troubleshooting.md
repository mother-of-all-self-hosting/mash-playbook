# Maintenance and Troubleshooting

## Checking the status of your services

You can check the status of your services using `systemctl status`. Example:

```sh
sudo systemctl status mash-miniflux
```

Example output:

```
‚óè mash-miniflux.service - Miniflux (mash-miniflux)
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/mash-miniflux.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2023-03-14 17:41:59 EET; 15h ago
```

You can view logs using `journalctl`. Example:

```sh
sudo journalctl -fu mash-miniflux
```

## Increasing logging

Various Ansible roles for services supported by this playbook support a `*_log_level` variable or some debug mode, which you can enable in your configuration to get extended logs.

[Re-run the playbook](installing.md) after making such configuration changes.

## Remove unused Docker data

You can free disk space from Docker by running:

```sh
docker system prune -a
```
on the server.

## Postgres

See the dedicated [PostgreSQL Maintenance](services/postgres.md#maintenance) documentation page.
