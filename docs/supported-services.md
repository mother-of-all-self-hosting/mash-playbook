## Related playbooks

- [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy (MDAD)](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) — for deploying a fully-featured [Matrix](https://matrix.org) homeserver. This playbook will remain independent, because the Matrix ecosystem is incredibly large — lots of bots, bridges and other pieces of software. It deserves its own dedicated playbook.

  The basic steps to configure the MDAD playbook and use it to install services are pretty same as doing so with the MASH playbook: **setting up prerequisites (if running this playbook on a different computer), retrieving the MDAD playbook, configuring it as well as the DNS records, and installing the services on the server**. If you have been accustomed to use the MASH playbook, it should not be difficult to set up and use this playbook too.
