# Specifies the type of reverse-proxy used by the playbook.

# Valid options and a description of their behavior:
#
# - `playbook-managed-traefik`
#     - the playbook will run a managed Traefik instance (mash-traefik)
#     - Traefik will do SSL termination, unless you disable it (e.g. `traefik_config_entrypoint_web_secure_enabled: false`)
#     - if SSL termination is enabled (as it is by default), you need to populate: `traefik_config_certificatesResolvers_acme_email`
#
# - `other-traefik-container`
#     - this playbook will not install Traefik
#     - nevertheless, the playbook expects that you would install Traefik yourself via other means
#     - you should make sure your Traefik configuration is compatible with what the playbook would have configured (web, web-secure entrypoints, etc.)
#     - you need to set `mash_playbook_reverse_proxyable_services_additional_network` to the name of your Traefik network
#
# - `none`
#     - no reverse-proxy will be installed
#     - no port exposure will be done for any of the container services
#     - it's up to you to expose the ports you want, etc.
